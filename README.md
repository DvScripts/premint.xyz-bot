## FAQ:
**Q:** Does it run on windows/mac?
<br>
**A:** Currently the biniary provided in releases were compiled with in mind of a windows user, You can try MAC but the compatibility may not be there. You can try running via a windows emulator or directly run the source.

**Q:** What did you use to compile the program?
<br>
**A:** Pyarmor & Pyinstaller

**Q:** What is 'Failed to check for handle status'?
<br>
**A**: It's a status code returned by the bot after trying to lookup the twitter user's handle, due to me not being accepted fast enough for a twitter developer api key I resorted into using a public api, downsides are other people can use them which quickens the API ratelimit. The solution would be waiting a few minutes before trying again.
